# learn-claude-code

**Learn Claude Code by building TokyoSentences, a Japanese study tool.**

A hands-on course teaching you to build software with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) — Anthropic's AI coding assistant. No prior programming experience required.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

**TokyoSentences** — a desktop app for managing Japanese language study materials. By the end of this course, you'll have built:

- A native desktop application (Electron)
- A local database (SQLite)
- Full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Version history and data export
- Search and filtering

More importantly, you'll learn how to describe what you want and let Claude Code build it.

## 🧠 The Core Skill

This course teaches one thing: **how to collaborate with AI to build software.**

You won't memorize syntax. You won't copy-paste from tutorials. Instead, you'll:

1. Describe what you want in plain English
2. Review what Claude Code proposes
3. Approve, refine, or redirect
4. Run and test the result
5. Repeat

This is how software gets built now.

## 🌏 Why "Tokyo"?

This course builds **TokyoSentences**, a tool from the [Never Fear Tokyo](https://www.youtube.com/@neverfeartokyo) project — a transmedia storyworld spanning three generations across Paris, Tokyo, and Buenos Aires.

The app manages Japanese sentence translations, vocabulary, and study materials. It's a real tool for a real project, not a throwaway tutorial.

You're building something that matters.
